<h1>About the STUR Framework</h1>

<p><strong>Sheldon’s Theory of Unified Resistance (STUR)</strong> is an open-source framework uniting electromagnetism, gravity, and quantum mechanics under a single resistance-based field formalism. Every equation, every simulator, and every derivation published here is the product of continuous iteration — physics evolved through logic, mathematics, and public dialogue.</p>

<p>STUR is open source because science itself is open source. No discovery belongs to a single individual — it belongs to the human process of questioning, testing, and refining. Transparency allows others to explore, replicate, and challenge ideas, and through that challenge, knowledge becomes stronger. The framework thrives because it is visible, testable, and accountable to everyone who studies it.</p>

<p>The simulations presented here — from quantum-scale resonators to cosmological fields — were developed collaboratively and iteratively, including live sessions with <strong>Grok on X</strong> and the open community of thinkers, skeptics, and engineers who engage with these concepts. Each iteration represents the essence of scientific inquiry: curiosity refined through repetition.</p>

<p>We welcome <strong>scrutiny, exploration, and creativity</strong>. The STUR Physics Lab exists not to protect ideas but to stress-test them, improve them, and evolve them. Whether you are a student, a physicist, or simply curious, you are invited to engage, reproduce, and expand these models.</p>

<p>Humanity stands at a precipice of both <strong>educational transformation</strong> and <strong>scientific revolution</strong>. Artificial intelligence, open collaboration, and self-publishing have dissolved the traditional barriers to discovery. Knowledge is no longer contained — it’s shared, remixed, and amplified by every new mind that encounters it. STUR exists to be a part of that transformation — a demonstration that unified physics can also mean <strong>unified participation</strong>.</p>

<p>The work continues. The math refines. The physics evolve. Every contribution, every simulation, and every honest question brings us one iteration closer to truth.</p>
